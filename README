Given a causal dynamical triangulation (CDT) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_dynamical_triangulation) of a fixed size, this code counts the number of sparse domino tailings (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_tiling) of the triangulation. The dominos are often referred to as dimers in the statistical mechanics literature. The result of this counting for CDTs of increasing size are contained in results.txt.

This code was used to verify the work in the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4322.

I release this code free of all copyright restrictions.
